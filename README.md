# Airbnb-Booking-Analysis-EDA-

# Overview
Leveraging advanced Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques, this project focuses on Airbnb's dataset to extract actionable insights. The primary objective is to uncover patterns in booking behaviors, preferences for different types of accommodations, and other key metrics. By employing various data manipulation and visualization methods, the analysis provides a deeper understanding of user interactions with the Airbnb platform.

# Project Summary
Airbnb is one of the online websites used worldwide for booking hotels, villas, resorts, etc. In this project, I delved into Airbnb's data to perform an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). The primary goal of this EDA project is to uncover valuable insights related to booking patterns, accommodation preferences, and other key metrics that can provide a deeper understanding of how users interact with the platform.

The dataset used in this analysis encompasses a variety of attributes, including different types of listings, neighborhood groups, and availability metrics. The Airbnb dataset was imported, and various data manipulation actions were taken, such as data wrangling, data cleansing, storytelling, and data visualization.

Data wrangling was performed to clean and organize the dataset, ensuring that it was ready for detailed analysis. This included handling missing values, correcting data inconsistencies, and converting data into appropriate formats.

Data cleansing was followed by storytelling, where the cleaned data was used to generate insights and narratives about booking trends and user preferences. This involved identifying key patterns and correlations within the data, such as the average price of rooms, types of neighborhood groups, total revenue generated, frequent customers, listing types, and the availability of accommodations across various neighborhoods.

Data visualization played a significant role in this project, as it helped to effectively communicate the findings from the analysis. Techniques such as kernel density estimation (KDE) plots, donut charts, pie charts, bar charts, heat maps, and correlation matrix maps were used.

Furthermore, the insights enable property owners and managers to tailor their marketing strategies more effectively. By highlighting the benefits of popular listing types and targeting specific neighborhoods with high availability, they can attract more customers and increase bookings. Additionally, addressing underperforming segments can help improve overall customer satisfaction and ensure that the offerings align with user preferences.

# Business Objective
1. Analyze the total revenue generation of neighbourhood group
2. Examine the patterns of bookings based on room types ie (Entire/home apt, Private room and Shared room)
3. To identify the top host name with number of time occurence
4. Percentage of bookings by neighbour hood group
5. Average minimum night stays
6. Based on the findings from the exploratory data analysis (EDA), identify potential areas where hotel operations could be improved or optimized.
7. The count of listings and their dominance within each neighborhood group, as well as the total revenue generated.

# Insights and Recommendation
1. Entire/Home Apt, private room is more preferred as compare to the shared rooms the properties owners and the marketing team should influence the customers for shared rooms as it will increase the number of bookings for shared rooms.
2. The percentage of bookings is highest in Manhattan, Brooklyn and queens neighbourhood group and the Bronx and staten island has lowest bookings.According to these insights the business management team for booking has to take certain steps in order to grab the customers.
3. Increase the availability of the rooms in various neighbourhood group. the availability should be as high as possible but in case of Queens, Bronx, and Staten island has lower availability which in turn it will reduces the no of bookings in this three neighbourhood group due to the unavailability of the rooms.
4. Increase the number of room types for Entire/Home apt and Private rooms in staten island, Brooklyn, queens as both the room types is highly preferred by the customers this will increase the total revenues.
5. Optimize Pricing, Implement dynamic pricing based on demand and seasonality.
